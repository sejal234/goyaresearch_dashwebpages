    A bar chart broken down by political actor and sentiment helps you understand how the connotation of the conversation changes as different political actors are being mentioned. 
    For instance, highly positive language or negative language around a specific actor helps show the commentator's emotions towards said actor.

            This tutorial shows you how to make a Dash Webpage, but to replicate the graph itself, use the plotly.express "bar" tool. 
            You can also follow the cleaning/graphing parts of this tutorial and ignore the configuration of the dash webpage. 
            To replicate the full webpage, use the following tutorial. Begin with import statements:

        dcc.Markdown(f'```python\n{c_import}\n```'),

        html.Br(),

        html.P(children='''
            Then, declare your "app" variable to create your Dash web app.
            '''),

        dcc.Markdown(f'```python\n{c_app}\n```'),

        html.Br(),

        html.P('''
        Your actor columns must be represented as a binary variable (a 1 if the actor is mentioned in the test, a 0 if not). 
        If you have not yet created actor columns (or found sentiment), reference the data cleaning page to learn more about what these columns are and get the steps to create them.
        Create a dataframe that groups by the sentiment and, for each actor, find the percent of tweets that are positive, negative, and neutral.
        We sort the values by negative %.

        Create a bar chart figure, where the actor is shown on the x-axis and two corresponding bars,

        This could also work as a standalone figure outside of a dash app.  '''),
